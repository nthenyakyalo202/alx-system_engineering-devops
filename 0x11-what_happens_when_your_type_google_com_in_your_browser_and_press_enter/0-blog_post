As a software engineer, have you ever wondered what happens when you type a URL like https://www.google.com into your browser and press enter? In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into the process of how a website is loaded on your browser, from the DNS request to the database.

1. DNS Request:
The first step in loading a website is the Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you enter a URL like https://www.google.com, your browser needs to resolve the domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address that the computer can understand. The browser sends a request to the local DNS resolver, which checks its cache to see if it already has the IP address for the domain name. If the IP address is not in the cache, the DNS resolver sends a request to the authoritative DNS server for the domain name. The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address for the domain name, and the DNS resolver caches the result for future requests.

2. TCP/IP:
Once the browser has the IP address for the domain name, it uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to establish a connection with the server at that IP address. The Internet Protocol (IP) is used to send packets of data between the browser and the server. The TCP protocol ensures that the packets are sent and received in the correct order, and that any missing packets are re-sent until the complete data has been received.

3. Firewall:
Before the connection is established, the server may be behind a firewall that blocks incoming connections. If the firewall is configured to allow connections from the IP address of the browser, the connection is established. Otherwise, the connection is rejected.

4. HTTPS/SSL:
If the website is using HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure), the browser and server negotiate a secure connection using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). The SSL/TLS protocol encrypts the data that is sent between the browser and server, making it difficult for anyone to intercept and read the data.

5. Load-balancer:
Once the connection is established, the request is sent to a load-balancer, which distributes the request to one of many servers that can handle the request. Load-balancers are used to ensure that no single server becomes overloaded with requests, and that the website remains responsive even under heavy load.

6. Web server:
The server that receives the request from the load-balancer is typically a web server such as Apache or Nginx. The web server processes the request and returns an HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) response to the browser. The response typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that the browser uses to render the website.

7. Application server:
If the website requires dynamic content such as user authentication or personalized content, the request is forwarded from the web server to an application server such as Tomcat or JBoss. The application server processes the request and generates a response that is sent back to the web server.

8. Database:
If the website requires data from a database such as MySQL or Oracle, the application server sends a query to the database server. The database server processes the query and returns the requested data to the application server, which incorporates the data into the response.

In conclusion, when you type a URL like https://www.google.com into your browser, a lot happens behind the scenes before the website is loaded on your screen. Understanding the web stack from DNS request to the database is crucial for any software engineer working in web development or networking.
